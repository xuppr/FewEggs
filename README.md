# Few Eggs shop

A mini spa playground for react router 6.

## Start the development server

```
npm start
```

## Build the app and serve the app

To build the app, run

```
npm run build
```

I suggest then to install http-server with npm and run

```
http-server /build
```

to serve the build folder.
